                <br>of Aquaculture and Hydroponics
            </p>
            <p>Aquaponics is essentially the combination of Aquaculture and Hydroponics. Both aquaculture and hydroponics have some down sides, hydroponics requires expensive nutrients to feed the plants, and also requires periodic flushing of the systems which can lead to waste disposal issues. Re-circulating aquaculture needs to have excess nutrients removed from the system, normally this means that a percentage of the water is removed, generally on a daily basis.

            <p>Fish are the power house of an aquaponics system, they provide the nutrients for the plants and if your growing edible fish, then they also provide protein for yourself. By following simple guidelines, growing fish from fingerling size to ready-to-eat fish can be extremely simple.</p>

            <p>The huge list of successful plants are basically anything that grows well above soil and love to have their roots wet. Plants such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and leafy green vegetables thrive really well with the aquaponics system.</p>
